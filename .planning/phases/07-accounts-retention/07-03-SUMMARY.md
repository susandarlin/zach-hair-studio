# Phase 7 Plan 03: Self-Service Cancel + Reschedule Summary

**Ownership-gated client cancel (Confirmed→Cancelled + slot release) and transactional book-new-then-cancel-old reschedule with Account Bookings UI.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-08-10T10:15:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-08-10T10:27:30Z
- **Tasks:** 3/3
- **Files modified:** 9

## Accomplishments

- `CancelForClientAsync` / `RescheduleForClientAsync` with D-09–D-12 gates (ownership, Confirmed, until-start)
- Reschedule uses `CreateExecutionStrategy` + `BeginTransactionAsync`; 409 leaves old Confirmed
- Landing `/account/bookings` Cancel confirm + Reschedule slot chips for upcoming Confirmed only

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: RED — ClientRescheduleTests** - `ed20708` (test)
2. **Task 2: GREEN — Cancel/Reschedule API** - `acec6f5` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Account Bookings UI** - `d7b8a33` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** `ddf2067` (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `ClientRescheduleRequestDto(+Validator).cs` — StartsAt + optional StylistId (PLAT-02)
- `AppointmentsService.cs` — CancelForClient / RescheduleForClient / shared TryBookNewAsync
- `AccountController.cs` — POST cancel + reschedule (Client role, NameIdentifier ownership)
- `ClientRescheduleTests.cs` — ACCT-04 / D-09–D-12 integration coverage (SqlServer)
- `AccountBookingActions.tsx` + `account.ts` + bookings page — UI-SPEC Cancel/Reschedule

## Decisions Made

- Shared `TryBookNewAsync` for guest create and client reschedule (single open-slot + unique-index path)
- Until-start uses `StartsAt <= UtcNow` consistent with create validator clock
- UI mounts actions only when `isUpcomingConfirmed`; server remains authoritative

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] AppointmentsService ctor broke unit test BuildService**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** Added `IValidator<ClientRescheduleRequestDto>` parameter; `AnyStylistAssignmentTests.BuildService` failed to compile
- **Fix:** Pass `new ClientRescheduleRequestDtoValidator()` into the manual construction
- **Files modified:** `API/ZachHairStudio.Api.Tests/Features/Appointments/AnyStylistAssignmentTests.cs`
- **Committed in:** `acec6f5`

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Shared-fixture unique-index collisions in ClientRescheduleTests**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (GREEN run)
- **Issue:** Multiple tests reused `(StylistId, SlotStart)` cells; later seeds failed after earlier tests left Confirmed slots
- **Fix:** Assigned distinct stylist/hour pairs per scenario (and kept past-start jitter)
- **Files modified:** `ClientRescheduleTests.cs`
- **Committed in:** `acec6f5`

**3. [Rule 2 - Correctness] RED NonOwner 404 asserted ProblemDetails title**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** Missing routes also return 404, so NonOwner tests passed before implementation
- **Fix:** Require body contains `Appointment not found` (ownership-gate ProblemDetails)
- **Files modified:** `ClientRescheduleTests.cs`
- **Committed in:** `ed20708` / refined in `acec6f5`

## TDD Gate Compliance

- RED: `ed20708` test(07-03)
- GREEN: `acec6f5` feat(07-03)
- No refactor commit required

## Known Stubs

None — cancel/reschedule helpers and UI are wired to live account endpoints.

## Threat Flags

None beyond plan threat model (T-07-10–T-07-15 mitigated by ownership, Client role, until-start, and reschedule transaction).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All key artifacts present on disk
- Commits `ed20708`, `acec6f5`, `d7b8a33` present in git log
- `ClientRescheduleTests`: 9/9 passed
