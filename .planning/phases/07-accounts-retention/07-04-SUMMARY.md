provides:
  - LoyaltyLedger append-only earn/redeem with filtered unique Earn AppointmentId

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - LoyaltyRates constants (1 pt / Completed; 10 pts = $5); never trust client discount dollars
    - Redeem inside OrdersService CreateExecutionStrategy transaction after catalog TotalAmount
    - Quote recomputes catalog + LoyaltyService; Continue to Payment recomputes again

# Phase 7 Plan 04: Loyalty Earn & Redeem Summary

**LoyaltyLedger earns +1 on staff Completed (idempotent per AppointmentId) and redeems at checkout as server-computed dollars (10 pts = $5) after catalog recompute — client discount $ never trusted.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-08-10T10:26:47Z
- **Completed:** 2026-08-10T10:34:13Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 28

## Accomplishments

- Append-only `LoyaltyLedger` + filtered unique Earn index; `LoyaltyService` balance/earn/quote/redeem
- Staff Completed hook and checkout/quote redeem with `RedeemPoints` only (D-13–D-16)
- Account `LoyaltyBalanceStrip` + CheckoutForm Apply Points from server quote responses
- Nine green `LoyaltyTests` on SqlServerWebApplicationFactory / Docker SQL

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: RED — LoyaltyTests** - `d7bd73d` (test)
2. **Task 2: GREEN — Ledger, earn, redeem** - `065787b` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Account strip + checkout redeem UI** - `a1441b2` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** `3960bba` (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `API/ZachHairStudio.Shared/Features/Loyalty/*` — entity, rates, service, DTOs
- `API/ZachHairStudio.Shared/Migrations/20260810103054_AddLoyaltyLedger.cs` — schema
- `AppointmentsService` / `OrdersService` / controllers — earn + redeem hooks
- `landing-page` — LoyaltyBalanceStrip, CheckoutForm redeem, cart/account helpers

## Decisions Made

- Earn/Redeem reason strings + SQL filtered unique on Earn AppointmentId (Pitfall 3)
- Payment failure restores points via positive compensating Redeem row (append-only)
- Optional Client Bearer on checkout/quote; Staff JWT cannot redeem

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing critical functionality] Payment-failure loyalty compensation**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (OrdersService redeem inside stock txn before Stripe)
- **Issue:** If payment session creation fails after a Redeem ledger row was committed, points would stay spent while stock is restored
- **Fix:** `CompensateFailedPaymentAsync` appends a positive compensating Redeem delta for the same OrderId
- **Files modified:** `API/ZachHairStudio.Shared/Features/Orders/OrdersService.cs`
- **Committed in:** `065787b`

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (Rule 2)
**Impact on plan:** Correctness for failed payment path; no scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None blocking. Docker SQL via `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` used for LoyaltyTests on Linux.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 07 plans complete for ACCT-01–07 MVP slice. Ready for phase verification / milestone close. RETN-02 tiers remain deferred.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: LoyaltyLedger.cs, LoyaltyService.cs, LoyaltyRates.cs, LoyaltyTests.cs, LoyaltyBalanceStrip.tsx, CheckoutForm.tsx, AddLoyaltyLedger migration
- FOUND commits: d7bd73d, 065787b, a1441b2
