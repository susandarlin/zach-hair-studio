# Phase 02 Plan 09: Reconcile Stale Planning Documents Summary

**Reworded two stale caption-acceptance assertions and appended an evidence-cited reconciliation to a stale gaps_found verification report — zero product code touched.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~20 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- `02-05-PLAN.md` (Task 2 `<action>` confirmation-panel step and `<acceptance_criteria>` confirmation-panel item) and `02-06-PLAN.md` (`<how-to-verify>` step 3) reworded so none assert the owner-removed "Save or screenshot this confirmation — email delivery isn't guaranteed" caption as a requirement; all three spots preserve the five self-sufficient confirmation fields (service, concrete stylist, salon-local date/time with zone label, duration, price) and carry a `[RECONCILED 02-09 — caption removed at owner request; see 02-06-SUMMARY.md Deviations + 02-VERIFICATION.md Concern 5]` provenance marker.
- `02-VERIFICATION.md` frontmatter `status` flipped from `gaps_found` to `reconciled`, with a new `reconciled: 2026-07-25` field and a `reconciliation_basis` provenance line; the original `gaps:` entry is annotated `resolution: RESOLVED` (citing commit `ea8eb85` + UAT Test 6) rather than deleted.
- A new `## Post-Verification Reconciliation (2026-07-25)` section appended after the original report body, citing: the email-content gap closed by commit `ea8eb85` and UAT Test 6; SC5's DST clause owner-descoped per UAT Test 9; the backend suite green 116/116 per UAT Test 8; and gap `G-02-8` resolved and reassigned to Phase 3 (DASH-05 test-isolation issue). The original 2026-07-10 Verdict Summary, Goal Achievement tables, and Concern analyses were left byte-for-byte unchanged above the new section.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Reconcile the stale removed-caption acceptance criteria in 02-05-PLAN.md and 02-06-PLAN.md** - `7a3ed64` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Append an evidence-cited reconciliation to 02-VERIFICATION.md and flip its stale gaps_found verdict** - `0de9e2b` (docs)

_Note: this is a documentation-only plan; no test/feat commits apply._

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/phases/02-booking-core/02-05-PLAN.md` - Reworded Task 2 `<action>` and `<acceptance_criteria>` caption assertions with RECONCILED 02-09 markers
- `.planning/phases/02-booking-core/02-06-PLAN.md` - Reworded `<how-to-verify>` step 3 caption assertion with a RECONCILED 02-09 marker
- `.planning/phases/02-booking-core/02-VERIFICATION.md` - Frontmatter status flip (`gaps_found` -> `reconciled`), gap entry annotated resolved, new dated `## Post-Verification Reconciliation (2026-07-25)` section appended

## Decisions Made
- Annotate-not-delete: every reworded spot and the flipped verdict preserve the historical text (via provenance markers / a `resolution` sub-field / an appended section) rather than silently rewriting the record, per the plan's explicit constraint.
- No files outside `.planning/phases/02-booking-core/` were touched; `ResendEmailService.cs` and `AppointmentBookingForm.tsx` were confirmed already correct and left untouched, matching the plan's hard constraint.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Both tasks' `<automated>` verify commands were run and produced the exact expected output (`grep -l "RECONCILED 02-09"` printed both plan paths; the compound gaps_found/reconciled/ea8eb85 check printed `RECONCILED_OK`).

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

The Phase-2 planning record is now internally consistent with shipped, owner-approved behavior: no plan silently contradicts the shipped confirmation UI, and 02-VERIFICATION.md no longer carries a stale blocking verdict. No further Phase-2 gap-closure work is indicated by this reconciliation. `git status --porcelain` after this plan's commits shows no changes outside the three target `.planning/` documents plus this plan's own SUMMARY/STATE bookkeeping.

## Self-Check: PASSED

All claimed files exist on disk (`02-05-PLAN.md`, `02-06-PLAN.md`, `02-VERIFICATION.md`, `02-09-SUMMARY.md`) and all claimed commit hashes (`7a3ed64`, `0de9e2b`, `8c5d81d`) are present in git history.
