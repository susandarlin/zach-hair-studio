# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-07)

**Core value:** Booking a salon appointment is effortless — browsing services and reserving a slot is the primary, friction-free path.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — staff-management-services-availability

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (staff-management-services-availability) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-27 — Phase 04 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Full P1-8 scope from specs/roadmap.md preserved as-is (8 integer phases); granularity=standard compression guidance overridden by explicit user scope choice.
- Roadmap: Per-feature service layer (PLAT-01) and validation layer (PLAT-02) introduced starting Phase 1, not deferred.
- Roadmap: Phase 2 ships a minimal/seeded availability model; Phase 4 makes the same model staff-editable — one system, not two.
- Roadmap: No-show modeled as a first-class terminal status starting Phase 3.
- Roadmap: Guest checkout (Phase 6) is independent of Accounts (Phase 7) — `Order.ClientId` nullable.
- Roadmap: `ZachHairStudio.Admin` MVC scaffold flagged as legacy/retire — noted at Phase 3, retirement criterion in Phase 8.
- Phase 1 Plan 02: ServicesController injects ServicesService and validators only; all Services DbContext access lives in ServicesService.
- Phase 1 Plan 02: Service write endpoints use controller-shaped ProblemDetails plus defensive service-layer FluentValidation.
- Phase 1 Plan 02: Services seed data uses EF Core HasData through AddServices migration; no UseSeeding/UseAsyncSeeding.
- Phase 1 Plan 03: Service detail booking CTA uses dedicated `/book?service={slug}` route, not the homepage contact anchor.
- Phase 1 Plan 04: Homepage shows first 6 services by `displayOrder`; `app/page.tsx` fetches once and passes services to both `Services` and `Contact` as props.
- Phase 1 Plan 04: `?service={slug}` preselect is validated against the fetched catalog and falls back to the empty option for unknown slugs (mitigates T-01-09).
- Phase 1 Plan 04: Booking API contract preserved — `createBooking` still receives a human-readable service string; Phase 2 rebuilds booking against real slots.
- Phase 1 Plan 04: `lib/data.ts` now holds only presentational site content; catalog data has a single database-backed source (D-14).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 3 Plan 01: IdentityRole<int> (not string-keyed IdentityRole) is the correct TRole for IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole<int>, int> given int-keyed ApplicationUser.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 01: base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder) moved to the start of BookingDbContext.OnModelCreating per ASP.NET Core IdentityDbContext convention.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 01: JwtTokenService uses a custom 'displayName' claim type since ClaimTypes has no built-in slot distinct from ClaimTypes.Name (login UserName).
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 02: AuthGateTests uses anonymous request objects + JsonDocument response parsing instead of the Shared DTO types, so the RED-phase test file compiles standalone before AuthController/StaffUsersController exist.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 02: Test JWT signing key injected via WithWebHostBuilder(...).ConfigureAppConfiguration(...) in-memory config, relying on the same mutable ConfigurationManager instance Program.cs's AddJwtBearer closure reads from at request time.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 02: StaffUsersController uses an explicit [Route("api/staff-users")] (not the [controller] token) since the default token would yield /api/staffusers with no hyphen.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 03: Global JsonStringEnumConverter registered in Program.cs so enum request/response fields (AppointmentStatusUpdateDto.NewStatus) round-trip as strings, matching AppointmentResponseDto.Status's existing string shape.
- [Phase 03]: Phase 3 Plan 03: UpdateStatusAsync re-reads the current status from the DB and checks the single AllowedTransitions map before mutating - the one reusable slot-release path for Cancel/NoShow, never a forked copy.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 2 Plan 07: SC5's DST-transition clause is descoped for the Asia/Yangon deployment (fixed UTC+06:30, never observes DST); DstBoundaryTests, DstRoundTripTests, and WritePathOffsetTests remain as the standing DST/offset proofs.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 2 Plan 07: Create-path test dates derive from a shared TestSupport.BookingDates helper (relative-to-now via SalonTimeZone) instead of hardcoded calendar literals, for any test crossing the future-gated AppointmentCreateDtoValidator.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 3 Plan 05: Hand-rolled CSS Grid day view with Asia/Yangon scheduleTime helpers — no calendar library.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 3 Plan 05: Schedule fetches all statuses; Cancelled/NoShow reveal is client-side includeCancelled toggle (D-08).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 3 Plan 05: POST /api/staff-users 201 Created treated as success on Owner add-staff form.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 01: Action-level (not class-level) [Authorize(Roles=Owner)] on ServicesController writes only — GET stays anonymous (Pitfall 5).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 01: Backfill IWebHostEnvironment.WebRootPath explicitly in Program.cs in addition to an explicit PhysicalFileProvider — ASP.NET Core leaves WebRootPath empty (not just the file provider) when wwwroot is absent at host-build time.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 01: Uploaded image filenames are Path.GetRandomFileName() + a content-type-derived extension, never the client FileName (path-traversal safe).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 02: GET /api/Services had no way to fetch retired services (frontend-only plan, no new API filter param) — retired/reactivated services were tracked in local session state (retiredOverrides). **Resolved by quick task 260725-mx3:** `includeInactive` query param added, honored only for an authenticated Owner (silently ignored otherwise, DD-1); `IsActive` is `bool?` omitted when null so the anonymous catalog response stays byte-identical (DD-2). The retiredOverrides workaround is gone.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 02: Service slug (required by DTOs, not a UI-SPEC field) is derived from Name via slugify() at first create and held fixed afterward so edits never change an already-public service URL.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 02: ServiceForm branches POST vs PUT on local serviceId state (persisted or not), not the static create/edit mode prop, so the form stays open after create to unlock image upload immediately.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 02: Multipart image upload uses a direct fetch() to POST /api/Services/{id}/image instead of the typed openapi-fetch client — the .NET OpenAPI doc documents the [FromForm] IFormFile body as application/x-www-form-urlencoded (a Swashbuckle quirk, not the real wire format).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 03: PUT working-hours replace returns 204 NoContent; POST time-off returns 201 Created via a string-URI Created(...) (no CreatedAtAction, no matching GET action exists); DELETE time-off returns 204 NoContent.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 03: AvailabilityService writes exclusively to StylistWorkingHours/StylistTimeOff (D-08) via a single implicit-transaction SaveChangesAsync (delete-then-insert), no manual BeginTransaction — mirrors AppointmentsService's EnableRetryOnFailure-safe pattern.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 04: Added GET /api/availability/{stylistId} — Plan 03 shipped write-only endpoints; the dashboard editor needs a read path, added reading only StylistWorkingHours/StylistTimeOff (D-08 preserved).
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 04: DayOfWeek (and other server enums) are typed number by Swashbuckle but serialize as string names via the global JsonStringEnumConverter — confirmed via live GET; cast explicitly on write, matching the AppointmentStatus precedent in scheduleStatus.ts.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 04: Kept the UI-SPEC's wider 06:00-22:00 week-strip default window over the narrower seeded 09:00-18:00 per-stylist default, giving staff painting room beyond the placeholder.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 05: Result<T>.Conflicts is a T-independent side-channel (not a repurposing of Data) since AddTimeOffAsync's success Data must stay the created StylistTimeOff entity.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 05: The conflict scan + persist for both working-hours and time-off writes run inside Database.CreateExecutionStrategy().ExecuteAsync wrapping a manual BeginTransactionAsync -- the one write path in this codebase needing a real transaction under EnableRetryOnFailure.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 05: Removing time off is never conflict-scanned -- it can only widen availability, never orphan a Confirmed appointment.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 05: AvailabilityConflictDto.SalonLocalTime carries the raw UTC instant; the dashboard formats it via the existing formatSalonDateTime helper rather than server-side pre-formatting.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 2 Plan 09: Reconcile-don't-delete pattern for stale planning docs — annotate with provenance markers instead of rewriting history
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 06: ESLint no-restricted-syntax core rule (no plugin/package) guards against onChange/emit* calls nested inside set*() state updaters -- the exact G-04-5 defect shape.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 06: WeekStripEditor commits the painted drag range via a previewRangeRef mirror (written on pointerdown/pointermove), letting handleUp call emitChange from its own event-handler body instead of inside the previewRange state updater -- closing G-04-5's render-phase parent setState.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4 Plan 07: WeekStripEditor resize commits as a direct per-segment array replace via emitChange, bypassing mergeSegments, so a shrink can never be silently re-expanded by the additive union logic (closes gap G-04-6).

### Pending Todos

- **REQUIREMENTS.md doc-sync (non-blocking).** CAT-01/CAT-02 were still marked `[ ]` Pending at Phase 1 verification despite being functionally complete — noted in `01-VERIFICATION.md` as a documentation-sync item, not a code gap.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md header/coverage text said "34 requirements" but the actual v1 list totals 41 — corrected in the Traceability/Coverage section during roadmap creation; worth a quick sanity check with the user.
- Phase 2 (Booking Core), Phase 6 (Cart & Checkout), and Phase 7 (Accounts & Retention) are flagged for a deeper per-phase research pass before planning (see ROADMAP.md Research flag annotations and research/SUMMARY.md Research Flags section).
- Payment provider (Phase 6) and auth provider/session strategy (Phase 7) remain open decisions per PROJECT.md Key Decisions — confirm before planning those phases.
- ~~Default `MSSQLLocalDB` fails on this machine~~ — **resolved 2026-07-09.** The corrupted automatic instance was deleted and recreated (now v17.0.4025.3); migrations apply cleanly to `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`, database `ZachHairStudio`. The API also runs against Azure SQL (`zachhairstudio.database.windows.net`) via a `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` env-var override — note the Azure SQL firewall must allow the client IP.
- `appsettings.json` `DefaultConnection` is `Server=localhost;...`, which disagrees with the `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` documented in CLAUDE.md. Use `dotnet user-secrets` (not `appsettings.json`) for any connection string carrying a password — gitleaks scanning is wired to the pre-commit hook.
